Prerequires
-----------
Install Python 3.8 from https://www.python.org/

Install associated libraries :
 * *numpy*
 * *random*
 * *cython*
 * *sphinx*
 * *numpydoc*
 * *sphinx-autoapi*
 * *sphinx-automodapi*
 * *sphinx-rtd-theme*
 
 The librairies prerequired should be installed from the install_prerequires.sh and install_prerequires.bat 
 (depending of system : .sh is the linux style script and .bat is the windows style script)
 
Installation
------------

This repository contain my last work :
The cmatrix.pyx is the optimised version of the matrix.py library containing all standar
algebrica opeations on matrix and usefull utils (save and load, quick access, quick programming, etc...)
It contains also a sequence recognition algorithm from raw data list (found as standalone methods of the module).

To compile it write in the command prompt :
 
 **python setup.py build_ext --inplace**
 
 Once compiled, load the module in python since the current directory with :
 
 **from cmatrix import \***

I've been working on an high-performance matrix code to rule standard matrix computation
on the Anubis calculator from Lenovo (Graph transistion matrix, System resolution, etc).

The library is fully operationnal on CentOS Unix-based system, tested and approved for Windows, Linux, and MacOS
