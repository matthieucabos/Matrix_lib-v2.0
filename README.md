This repository contain my current works in progress :
The cmatrix.pyx is the optimised version of the matrix.py library containing all standard
algebrica opeations on matrix and usefull utils (save and load, quick access, quick programming, etc...)
 To compile it write in the command prompt :
 
 python setup.py build_ext --inplace
 
 The help documentation may be found using index.html
 
I've been working on an high-performance matrix code to rule many of standard calculation
on the Anubis calculator (Graph transistion matrix, System resolution, etc) from Lenovo.

The library is fully operationnal on CentOS Unix-based system
